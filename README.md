# YouTube Intelligence System

A Deterministic Agentic system for processing YouTube videos and performing downstream AI tasks such as summarization, key-point extraction, question generation and RAG based question answering.

The system extracts and processes video transcripts into structured representations while using shared caching and modular pipelines to reduce redundant LLM calls, optimize cost, and improve scalability.

## Core Modules
- Summarization Module
- Key-Points Generation Module
- Question Generation Module
- RAG Answering Module

## Architecture Decisions

### Transcript Extraction
* Primary: YouTube Transcript API
* Fallback: Whisper transcription

### Adaptive Chunking Strategy
| Video Type | Processing Strategy | Reason
|---|---|---|
| Small Videos | Raw chunks | Full context retained without additional processing
| Medium Videos | Top-K retrieval | Improves relevance filtering
| Long Videos | KMeans clustering | Improves coverage by selecting diverse semantic centroids and reducing redundancy

### Single-Pass LLM Generation
All processed chunks are merged and passed through a single LLM call per module.
This design replaces multi-stage summarization pipelines with a single inference step, reducing latency and API usage while preserving context.

### Mode-Specific Prompting
Prompts are dynamically selected based on video length:
* Short → detail preservation
* Medium → relevance-focused generation
* Long → abstraction and coverage optimization

### Multi-Layer Caching
Caching is applied across:
* transcripts
* raw and processed chunks
* vector store
* LLM outputs

### Evaluation & Observability
Includes:
* unit, integration, and smoke tests
* structured logging and tracing
* LLM-based and RAG evaluation

### Model Strategy
Multi-model comparison is deprioritized due to:
* multiple LLM calls per request (classification + generation)
* external provider rate limits (especially in free-tier environments)

### Environment Separation
* Development: benchmarking, evaluation endpoints, health checks
* Production: inference-only API surface

### Deterministic Orchestration vs Autonomous Agents
Uses a deterministic pipeline instead of autonomous agents because the workflow is fixed and structured, reducing orchestration complexity and overhead.
