# YouTube RAG Intelligence System

An intelligent RAG system for processing YouTube videos and performing downstream AI tasks such as summarization, key-point extraction, question generation, and contextual question answering.

The system extracts and processes video transcripts into structured representations while using shared caching and modular pipelines to reduce redundant LLM calls, optimize cost, and improve scalability.

## Core Modules
- Summarization Module
- Key-Points Generation Module
- Question Generation Module
- RAG Answering Module

## Architecture Overview
This system is a deterministic pipeline for YouTube video understanding, optimized for low latency, cost efficiency, and scalable retrieval-based reasoning.

### Transcript Extraction
* Primary: YouTube Transcript API
* Fallback: Whisper transcription
Ensures fast-path retrieval with graceful degradation when transcripts are unavailable.

### Adaptive Chunking Strategy
Video Type	Strategy
Short	Raw chunks
Medium	Top-K retrieval
Long	K-Means clustering
Different video lengths introduce varying challenges in retrieval and token efficiency.
* Short videos: full context retained without additional processing
* Medium videos: Top-K retrieval improves relevance filtering
* Long videos: K-Means improves coverage by selecting diverse semantic centroids and reducing redundancy

### Single-Pass LLM Generation
All processed chunks are merged and passed through a single LLM call per module.
This design replaces multi-stage summarization pipelines with a single inference step, significantly reducing latency and cost while preserving contextual completeness.

### Mode-Specific Prompting
Prompts are dynamically selected based on video length:
* Short → detail preservation
* Medium → relevance-focused generation
* Long → abstraction and coverage optimization
Prompt versions are maintained for iterative improvement and reproducibility.

### Multi-Layer Caching
Caching is applied across:
* transcripts
* chunks
* processed chunks
* vector store
* LLM outputs
Reduces redundant computation and API overhead across repeated requests.

### Evaluation & Observability
Includes:
* unit, integration, and smoke tests
* structured logging and tracing
* LLM-based evaluation (clarity, completeness, usefulness)
* RAG evaluation (faithfulness, relevance)

### Throttling & Rate Control
Implements request throttling to ensure system stability under multi-stage LLM pipelines and external API rate limits.

### Model Strategy
A single primary LLM is used across modules.
Multi-model comparison is deprioritized due to:
* multiple LLM calls per request (classification + generation + evaluation)
* increased latency and cost
* external provider rate limits (especially in free-tier environments)

### Environment Separation
* Development: benchmarking, evaluation endpoints, health checks
* Production: inference-only API surface
Ensures safe deployment and reduced attack surface.

### Deterministic Orchestration vs Autonomous Agents
The system intentionally uses a deterministic pipeline architecture instead of autonomous agent-based workflows.
The problem space is highly structured and consists of fixed stages
- transcript extraction
- chunking and preprocessing
- retrieval or clustering
- single-pass generation
- evaluation and benchmarking
Autonomous agent frameworks were avoided as they introduce unnecessary orchestration complexity and multi-step reasoning overhead for a well-defined pipeline problem.
